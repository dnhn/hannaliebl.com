TODO:
[ ] Sort out SASS stuff since Hugo now supports it - make sure it works
[ ] Remove all the Gulp cruft
[ ] Why does `hugo new` not give me a timestamp anymore?
[ ] Blank pages for /work/categories, etc
[ ] Remove outdated project links, mention when projects no longer work due to domain name expiration, API access issues, etc
[ ] Finish personal blog section/li/single styles
