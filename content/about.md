I've been a developer since 2012, when I started making Wordpress sites. I currently work in Portland, Oregon on a [SaaS web application](https://radarfirst.com/), writing JavaScript, designing UIs, and doing some backend work in Go. I try to keep up with the ever-changing web development world. Technologies, frameworks, and tools I have experience with include: **Angular**, **Backbone**, **Node**, **D3**, **Rails**, **SASS/LESS**, **Gulp**, **Grunt**, **Git**, and **various design programs**, with a strong preference for Adobe Illustrator. Right now, I'm focusing on improving my Go programming skills, and I am excited about the growing, friendly community around that language.

Outside of programming, I enjoy exploring Portland, playing computer games with friends, weightlifting, and fostering cats for the Oregon Humane Society.

I sometimes [Tweet](https://twitter.com/lieblhan), and I am available for select freelance workâ€“[send me an email](mailto:hanna.liebl@gmail.com?subject=Hello!) if you have a project I could help with.

## What About the Site?

I'm glad you asked! This site is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Golang-based site generator. I wrote the CSS myself (though, I borrowed some excellent practices from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).) The fonts are served from Google, the icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), and the syntax highlighting uses the [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/). The entire thing is on [Github](https://github.com/hannaliebl/hannaliebl.com), if you are curious.
