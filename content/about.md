I've been a developer since 2012, when I started making Wordpress sites. I currently work in New Jersey for [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), helping to make government digital services better. I try to keep up with the ever-changing web development world. Technologies, frameworks, and tools I have experience with include: **React**, **Angular**, **Backbone**, **Node**, **D3**, **Rails**, **SASS/LESS**, **Webpack**, **Gulp**, **Grunt**, **Git**, and **various design programs**, with a strong preference for Adobe Illustrator.

Outside of programming, I enjoy hiking, playing computer games with friends (and by "computer games" I really mean "Dota 2"), and Crossfit.

I sometimes [Tweet](https://twitter.com/lieblhan), and I am available for select freelance workâ€“[send me an email](mailto:hanna.liebl@gmail.com?subject=Hello!) if you have a project I could help with.

## What About the Site?

I'm glad you asked! This site is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Golang-based site generator. I wrote the CSS myself (though, I borrowed some excellent practices from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).) The fonts are served from Google, and the icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). The entire thing is on [Github](https://github.com/hannaliebl/hannaliebl.com), if you are curious.
