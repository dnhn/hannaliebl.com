I've been a developer since 2012, when I started making Wordpress sites. I currently work for [Truss](https://truss.works/), helping to make government digital services better. Before that, I worked for [Ad Hoc](https://adhocteam.us/), where I helped improve the enrollment experience on healthcare.gov, and before that, I worked for startups in Portland, Oregon, doing primarily JavaScript development. These days I tend to work primarily in React, but I have interest and some experience in Node, Go, and Ruby/Rails.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, hiking, playing video games, Crossfit, and spending time with my family.

I sometimes [Tweet](https://twitter.com/lieblhan), and I am available for select freelance workâ€“[send me an email](mailto:hanna.liebl@gmail.com?subject=Hello!) if you have a project I could help with.

## What About the Site?

I'm glad you asked! This site is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Golang-based site generator. I wrote the CSS myself (though, I borrowed some excellent practices from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).) The fonts are served from Google, and the icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). The entire thing is on [Github](https://github.com/hannaliebl/hannaliebl.com), if you are curious.
