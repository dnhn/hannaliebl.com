From 2017 to 2021, I worked at [Ad Hoc](https://adhoc.team/), where I helped build and improve web applications on healthcare.gov, specifically around the enrollment process and apps that help with tax forms. This work is done primarily in React, though I've had the opportunity to do some Go work as well.

I also contribute back to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Design System ([design.cms.gov](https://design.cms.gov/)), an open-source design system and library of React components that is used to standardize the user experience across healthcare.gov.
