This project is built in React. I did it to practice using forms in React, because they provide a scoped-down technical challenge that still presents some complexity like form validation. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/hannaliebl/fitness-calculations).

The site currently takes your metrics and uses the Mifflin-St. Jeor formula to calculate your basal metabolic rate and total daily energy expenditure (basically, how many calories you burn daily.) I intend to add some other routes with other useful fitness calculations down the line.
