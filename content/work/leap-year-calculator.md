This was a quick, fun personal project both to practice JavaScript and website design. The site does calculations related to leap years based on user input. It goes from simply telling the user when the next leap year is to calculating whether a single year is a leap year to finding all the leap years within a given range. The site uses JavaScript to do these calculations and jQuery to handle inputting user data and then showing the results. I began with the Bootstrap framework to speed up development time, but I modified these styles to create a relatively flat, elegant design, with some jQuery and CSS3 effects to improve usability and user experience. I also made the logo used at the top of the page.
