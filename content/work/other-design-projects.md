I have designed and built other websites that are no longer online. For example, I made a website for a dentist in my hometown. In addition to listing his location and services, it featured custom Photoshop illustrations I made. I also designed a Wordpress-powered site for my alma mater's ultimate frisbee teams. The teams used the site to publish rosters, tournament news, and photos.

I have additional work making designs for use on merchandise. I have made illustrations and logos that were printed on shirts and merchandise at ultimate frisbee tournaments.
