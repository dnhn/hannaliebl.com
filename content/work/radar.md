From 2014 - 2017 I worked at [Radar](https://www.radarfirst.com), a company in Portland, Oregon that helps companies assess, track, and report data breach incidents.

I helped develop and test Radar's web application. Most of my work was in AngularJS, though I got the opportunity to work with Go as well. Some of the projects I did while at Radar: I made a customizable, interactive dashboard with D3 charts, the backend (in Go) and UI for automating the printing of notification letters, and the form logic for assessing incidents. I got a lot of experience working on a small engineering team, writing good JavaScript, and learning about accessibility.
