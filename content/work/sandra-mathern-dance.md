Sandra Mathern needed an online portfolio to showcase videos and photos of her performances, to list the awards she has received and the locations she has performed, and to display other professional information about her work. I worked on the front end implementation and design of this site and Cyrus Smith did the custom JavaScript development. We met with Sandra multiple times and went over what she needed and refined the design and the uses she had in mind for the site.

The site features a sparse opening page that primarily highlights photographs of Sandra, and the photo-heavy content continues on the other pages. The entire site, both pictures and text, is easily updated through WordPress, and uses a responsive design to scale flexibly from mobile devices up to large desktop monitors.
