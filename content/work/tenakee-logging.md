This website is the first for Tenakee Logging Company, so I wanted to make sure it got across both practical information about the services the company offers and its history, but also communicated its uniqueness as a father-son business and a company committed to sustainable logging practices. Additionally, I wanted the site to show off the landscape and natural beauty of Tenakee Springs and the surrounding Tongass National Forest, since this is so tied into the company’s ideals to harvest lumber sustainably.

Conveniently, Gordon Chew, the company’s owner and operator, had taken a lot of beautiful landscape photographs over the years, so I chose to highlight his photography on the site. Each page features a photographic banner, and a subtly changing color scheme to match those photographs. The site also uses wood textures and earthy colors to match the business.

I developed all the graphics for the site, including the TLC logo found on every page. I worked with Gordon over months to combine text with images and to develop meaningful content. In the end, the site gives potential and current customers a good overview of what the company offers, and also gives anyone who’s interested some snapshots of the beautiful Tenakee Springs area and information about what sustainable logging is and why its important.
