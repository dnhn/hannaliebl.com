    Welcome to my blogâ€“I write mainly about web development and front end
    design. By day, I work as a JavaScript developer in Western Massachusetts, and by night,
    I try to keep up to date with the ever-exciting front end/software
    development world. Get in touch with me on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/lieblhan">Twitter</a> or see what I've been
    learning on <a href="https://github.com/hannaliebl">Github</a>.
